# This module is designed to be able to roll out features to a
# random segment of users for A/B testing. This takes as input a
# list of features along with % chance they will be enabled,
# decides which to enable, and persists these decisions into the
# application cache.
#
# This module takes in no outside data, so it is limited in it's
# uses. While a feature can be persisted between builds for the
# same app, it cannot be consistent for a given user / team. Even
# different PR apps will be decided independently.
#
# This means that this should not be used for changing the build 
# behavior of the buildpack. Builds should always work consistently
# no matter what features are turned on or off.
#
# Where this module can be useful is when deciding between two 
# identical behaviors that may have performance trade-offs, or
# testing the efficacy of different messaging. 
#
# Examples: 
#    testing two different caching strategies against each other
#    showing guidance on a particular type of failure
#
# It is expected that these features will be used for roll-outs 
# and be short-lived
#
# ** Schema **
#
# This module expects a "schema" file as input. This is used to
# make sure that all current features are documented in one 
# place. The file is a list of key=value pairs on individual 
# lines.
#
# The key is the name, and the value is an integery between 0 and
# 100 inclusive that represents the likelyhood that the feature
# will be turned on for any given app.
#
# Example:
# ```
# always-on=100   // this will always be turned on, not super useful
# ab-test=50      // this will be split 50/50
# small-test=5    // this will be turned on for 5% of apps
# ```
#
# ** Invalidating features **
#
# Any time the schema file contents change, the existing feature
# assignments will be invalidated and re-assigned
#
# ** Testing **
#
# It would be frustrating if it wasn't clear when CI was running which
# branch was being used, or if tests were flaky because they were choosing
# different features for each run.
#
# To that end, there is a special file that can be included in test fixtures
# to hard-code features to turn on and off.
# 
# $BUILD_DIR/heroku-buildpack-features
#
# Example:
# ```
# feature-a=true 
# feature-b=true 
# ```
#
# An empty file can be included as part of test code to default all tests
# to off
#
# Once a feature is in production, checking this file into your app
# can allow you to choose which features you want an app to use.
